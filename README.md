# Setup guide

2. Update or install npm  (npm install) and type npm start to start the project.


# Documentation information

The cost and timeline defined at the start of the project can be found under Start Documentation.
I believe that my evaluation of the time need of 120 hours (3 full time week) to complete the project was in the right range
for an experienced front-end developer.
However, it's difficult for me to evaluate the exact time I spend on this website, as it was often spread out in time over two months.

# Project status 3.09.2017

This project is not complete.  
I decided to leave the following element out because of time constraint and in perspective of a future collaboration with a back-end developer.

I believe that the following element could be improved :

- Full responsive Ipad.
- Cross Browser full testing (Android, older Version of Windows)
- Payment solution
- Backend

# Personal Reflection

First I would like to say that I really enjoyed this project, even if I wish I could have done a few things differently.
I learned a lot and that's will for sure be an advantages in the future.
I started this project with confidence back in June fully believe that I could do most of the work even part of the back end.
I quickly realized that time would be an issue.  However I keep trying to work on it most of the days, and I’m  quite happy which what I learned, as I improve my javascript/jquery skills.
